    "1. **Feedback Loop**: Interactive blueprint generation using textual or visual input.\n",
    "2. **Blueprint Inspection**: View the agent's current blueprint and structure dimensions.\n",
    "3. **Reflection Mechanism**: Evaluate the agent's internal understanding of the designed structure.\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Design**: Specify new structures directly via textual descriptions.\n",

    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Ensure `ArchitectAgent` is initialized and ready to use.\n",
    "- Provide valid URLs for image-based inputs if used.\n",

    "**Note**: This demonstration uses textual or image-based prompts to guide the agent's blueprint creation.\n"

      "#### 3. **Description**\n",
      "- **Purpose and Design**: The structure seems to be a simple base level or foundation, potentially for a small platform or the beginning of a larger construction. The design is basic, consisting of a square 2x2 platform made entirely of wooden blocks.\n",

      "- **Construction Sequence**:\n",
      "  - **Step 1**: Start by placing Block 1 at the designated starting point (0,0,0).\n",
      "  - **Step 2**: Attach Block 2 to the right of Block 1 on the x-axis.\n",
      "  - **Step 3**: Add Block 3 directly in front of Block 1 on the z-axis.\n",
      "  - **Step 4**: Finally, place Block 4 at the intersection of Block 2 and Block 3, completing the square layout.\n",
